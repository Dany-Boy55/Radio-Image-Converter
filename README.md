# Radio Image Converter
A simple to use app that lets you create custom images for your radio control system

Functionality thus far:
- Import a single image file
- Convert a single image into a 64x32 indexed 4BPP bitmap (Taranis X9D)
- Save the converted image to a bitmap

Functionality to be added for basic functionality:
- Allow different image formats for different radio systems

Possible features to be implemented in future releases:
- Process multiple image files at once
- Add the ability to create splash screens for OpenTX radios

Right now the code is functional but not really usable, you must build the solution yourself. 
When I'm fairly happy with the result, I will provide a compiled app that can be easily used. 

Feel free to report any sort of bugs that you may find. Also let me know if you want a special feature added and I'll see what I can do!
