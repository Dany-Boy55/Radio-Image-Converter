# Radio Image Converter
A simple to use app that lets you create custom images for your radio control system
Simply select a photo, and convert it to a Taranis X9D compatible format with a single click!

Functionality thus far:
- Import a single image file:
  - By double clikcing the source image space
  - By going into the file menu and clikcing import
  - By drag-dropping an image into the app (buggy)
- Convert a single image into a 64x32 indexed 4BPP bitmap (Taranis X9D)
- Naming the image file with OpenTX conventions
- Auto-Scale UI to propperly display all elements when resizing the main form
- Save the single converted image to a bitmap file to a user selected folder

Bugs to be squashed:
- Drag drop image import not recognizing some images (still not clear which)

Possible features to be implemented in future releases:
- Process multiple image files at once
- Add more image parameters for other radio systems
- Add the ability to create splash screens for OpenTX radios

Code is functional and usable! Check the [Releases](../Dany-Boy55/Radio-Image-Converter) tab for a compiled ready to use app!

Feel free to report any sort of bugs that you may find. Also let me know if you want a special feature added and I'll see what I can do!
